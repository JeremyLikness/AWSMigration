## Quick Start

You can get started quickly with the migrated function. Simply click or tap the "Deploy to Azure" button. Be sure to enter a unique prefix (for example, use your initials or add a sequence). After the deployment is done, you can access and test the function.

> To enable the cache, navigate to the storage account after it is created. Click on `Tables` under `Table service` then add a table named `primes`.

## The Code

This repository contains code for all related projects.

### Source ("Pure") Function

The function itself determines whether a number passed is prime or not. The pure function is available in `src\isItAPrime.js`.

### AWS Lambda

The source for the AWS Lambda function is in `aws\isItAPrime.js`.

### Azure

The portal-based version of the Azure Function is available under `azure\portal`.

The actual code produced in Part 5 for local functions is under `azure\local`.
